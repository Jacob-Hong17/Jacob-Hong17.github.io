==Time Series Forecasting with Graphical Models

The recently emerged Graph signal processing (GSP) techniques provide efficient ways to utilize the geographical information. 
Previous time series models on graph often use the k-nearest-neighbor algorithm to construct the graph structure among the 
nodes through their latitude and longitude, and make prediction.  People have found itâ€™s better to process the graph signal in 
graph frequency domain when the data show graph stationary.\n

\n
However, previous time series models on graph seldom care about the non-stationary case. Hence, we proposed the multivariate 
GARCH models on graphs (G-GARCH), which consider about the relationship among the geographical information and the volatility. 
The G-GARCH model has the advantage of parameter saving if the data in graph frequency domain are uncorrelated. Additionally, 
the G-GARCH model can be extend to asymmetric case, like Graph Exponential GARCH (G-GARCH), and Graph GJR-GARCH (G-GJR-GARCH).\n

\n
We have apply these Graph GARCH models into wind power forecasting and temperature forecasting, and achieve significantly 
improvements comparing with previous time series models. The results are shown in the following figures. \n
